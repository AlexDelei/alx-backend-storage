### What is Redis ?

Redis (Remote Dictionary Server) is an open-source, in-memory data structure store used as a database, cache, and message broker. It supports various data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets, bitmaps, hyperloglogs, and geospatial indexes with radius queries.

#### Major Key points about Redis
1. **In-Memory Storage**: Redis stores data in memory, which allows for very fast read and write operations. This makes it ideal for use cases where low latency and high throughput are crucial.
